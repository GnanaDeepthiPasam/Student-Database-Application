# Student Database Application

## Technologies used:
Java: Programming language

## Tools used:
Eclipse

## Project description:
In this project, I have played a role as a Database Administrator for a university and created an application to manage student enrollments and tuition balance. I have carried out the following tasks in order to build this application:
1. Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
2. The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
3. The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
4. A student can enroll in the courses
5. Each course cost $600 to enroll
6. To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
